A workshop to help you reuse your SwiftUI skills to build an elegant macOS app

Thank you so much for attending my workshop. I hope you'll be excited about building a macOS app in a near future! You can always reach out to me on [Twitter](https://x.com/bionik6).

### Important note
Since the app is using WeatherKit, you need to register it in the app developer console.
Go to the [Identifier section](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list), register the app and change its capabilities. You need to activate it in two places actually.
